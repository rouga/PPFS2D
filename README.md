# PPFS2D
PPFS2D is a 2D potential flow solver using Chapel, which is a simple parallel programming language that can do shared- and distributed-memory programming.

" The language designers aspire for Chapel to bridge the gap between current HPC programming practitioners, who they describe as Fortran, C or C++ users writing procedural code using technologies like OpenMP and MPI on one side, and newly graduating computer programmers who tend to prefer Java, Python or Matlab with only some of them having experience with C++ or C " -__Wikipedia__
